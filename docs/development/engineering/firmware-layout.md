# Firmware Layout

This repository is a minimal base for user-defined firmware targeting an
ESP32-C3 with 8 MB Flash. Its default does not reserve product-specific
identity, OTA, or unused data partitions.

## Default layout

The default partition table contains exactly:

| Partition | Type/subtype | Offset | Size | Purpose |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `nvs` | data/NVS | `0x9000` | `0x6000` | ESP-IDF and application key-value storage |
| `phy_init` | data/PHY | `0xF000` | `0x1000` | PHY initialization data |
| `factory` | app/factory | `0x10000` | `0x7F0000` | The single application image; all remaining Flash |

The default has no OTA slots. This is a starting point, not a restriction on
user firmware.

## Custom layouts

Users may edit `partitions.csv` to resize, move, add, or remove partitions for
their application. A custom table may use OTA slots, filesystem/resource
partitions, or other application-specific data. Keep the 8 MB device boundary,
avoid overlaps, and make sure the application image is flashed at the start of
an app partition large enough to contain it. When a derivative changes its
layout, update that project's documentation and flashing instructions.

## Enforced validation

Run:

```bash
./tools/validate.sh --firmware
```

The check builds in an isolated directory, creates the merged image, reads the
configured image offsets from `flash_args`, validates the partition-table MD5,
partition bounds, unique labels, and non-overlap, then ensures the application
offset matches an app partition large enough to contain it. It intentionally
does not require the default partition list. CI runs the same gate.

Upload only `build/FoloToy-AI-Passport-full.bin`; the similarly named app-only
`build/FoloToy-AI-Passport.bin` does not contain the bootloader or partition
table.

## Flashing and stored data

Firmware and user data are different. If existing NVS settings, application
records, or files must be kept, export or otherwise save them before flashing
using a method supported by that application. Not requiring an original-firmware
backup does not guarantee data preservation or authorize a full-chip erase.

The verified merged image is written from `0x0`. Because the merged file pads
the gaps between images, flashing it can reset the NVS and PHY data regions.
Use the merged image for blank-device provisioning or an intentional complete
refresh. During normal development, use segmented `idf.py flash` when existing
NVS state should be preserved; this also requires a compatible partition layout
and flash targets that do not overwrite those data regions. `idf.py erase-flash`
erases all user data. Do not add it as a routine prerequisite: use it only when
a complete erase is explicitly intended and any data that must be kept has
been saved.
